🚗 Electric Vehicle Data Analysis Dashboard – Project Summary
📊 Dashboard Objective:

Developed a comprehensive and interactive Tableau dashboard to analyze electric vehicle adoption trends across the United States, using a dataset of 150,422 registered EVs.

Aimed to uncover insights into EV growth patterns, manufacturer performance, model popularity, and CAFV (Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle) eligibility.

📌 Key Metrics Displayed:

Total EVs: 150,422

Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV): 116,750 (77.61% of total EVs)

Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV): 33,672 (22.39% of total EVs)

Average Electric Range: 67.83 miles across all EV types

📈 Trend Analysis:

Line chart shows year-wise growth in EV registrations from 2011 to 2025 (2024 and 2025 as forecast).

Significant growth observed post-2017, with the highest growth recorded in 2024 (estimated 46.3K vehicles).

Forecast data indicates continued growth trajectory into 2025 (62.6K+ vehicles).

🗺️ Geographical Insights:

Interactive U.S. map representing total EVs by state.

Allows users to identify top-performing states in EV adoption.

Filter by individual state to analyze regional distribution patterns.

🏭 Manufacturer-Level Breakdown:
